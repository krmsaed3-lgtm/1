    <li>Users can start by depositing a small amount of USDT (such as 10 or 100 USDT).</li>
    <li>After depositing, users activate a simple start button.</li>

  </ul>

  <p><strong>2. What Job AI Does Behind the Scenes</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Deposited funds are used to rent powerful cloud servers.</li>
    <li>
      These servers run various computing tasks, including artificial intelligence (AI),
      data processing, network verification, node operations, and related services.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>3. How Job AI Generates Profit</strong></p>

    <li>These activities may generate around 2 USDT per day.</li>
    <li>The user receives 1 USDT as a fixed daily return.</li>
    <li>The remaining amount represents the platform’s profit.</li>
  </ul>

    infrastructure, and daily profits are shared. This model is built on actual services rather
    than promises, making it suitable for users seeking stable and reasonable daily income.
